##Baseline Protocol Improvement Proposals##

The main Baseline Protocol website is at: https://baseline-protocol.org

The Baseline Protocol Standard is located here: https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard

And the official Baseline Protocol core interfaces, reference implementations, and examples are located here: https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline

The core devs and standards body of the Baseline Protocol, an [EEA-Community Projects](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/) initiative administrated by [Oasis-Open.org](https://oasis-open.org), use this repo to collect, organize, priorititize, and track progress on improvements to the Baseline Protocol standard and codebase.

Use the Issues in the Repo with the provided simple templates, modeled on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) format.
